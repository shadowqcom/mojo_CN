# @register\_passable

You can add the `@register_passable` decorator on a struct to tell Mojo that the type should be passed in machine registers (such as a CPU register; subject to the details of the underlying architecture). For tiny data types like an integer or floating-point number, this is much more efficient than storing values in stack memory. This means the type is always passed by value and cannot be passed by reference.

The basic `@register_passable` decorator does not change the fundamental behavior of a type: it still needs an `__init__()` and `__copyinit__()` method to be copyable (and it may have a `__del__()` method, if necessary). For example:

```
@register_passablestruct Pair:    var a: Int    var b: Int    fn __init__(inout self, one: Int, two: Int):        self.a = one        self.b = two    fn __copyinit__(inout self, existing: Self):        self.a = existing.a        self.b = existing.bfn test_pair():    var x = Pair(5, 10)    var y = x    print(y.a, y.b)    y.a = 10    y.b = 20    print(y.a, y.b)
```

```
test_pair()
```

5 10 10 20

This behavior is what we expect from `Pair`, with or without the decorator.

Updated syntax

Register passable types now accept standard lifecycle methods, as shown above. Prior to Mojo 24.1, register-passable types required a non-standard constructor that returned a value, with syntax like this: `return Self{a: one, b: two}`. The older syntax is still supported but will be removed in a future release. For more information about this change, see the [Mojo 24.1 release notes](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog#v241-2024-02-29).

You should be aware of a few other observable effects:

1. `@register_passable` types cannot hold instances of types that are not also `@register_passable`.
    
2. `@register_passable` types do not have a predictable identity, and so the `self` pointer is not stable/predictable (e.g. in hash tables).
    
3. `@register_passable` arguments and result are exposed to C and C++ directly, instead of being passed by-pointer.
    
4. `@register_passable` types cannot have a [`__moveinit__()` constructor](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life.html#move-constructors), because values passed in a register cannot be passed by reference.
    

## `@register_passable("trivial")`

Most types that use `@register_passable` are just "bags of bits," which we call "trivial" types. These trivial types are simple and should be copied, moved, and destroyed without any custom constructors or a destructor. For these types, you can add the `"trivial"` argument, and Mojo synthesizes all the lifecycle methods as appropriate for a trivial register-passable type:

```
@register_passable("trivial")struct Pair:    var a: Int    var b: Int
```

This is similar to the [`@value`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/decorators/value.html) decorator, except when using `@register_passable("trivial")` the only lifecycle method you're allowed to define is the `__init__()` constructor (but you don't have to)â€”you _cannot_ define any copy or move constructors or a destructor.

Examples of trivial types include:

- Arithmetic types such as `Int`, `Bool`, `Float64` etc.
- Pointers (the address value is trivial, not the data being pointed to).
- Arrays of other trivial types, including SIMD.

For more information about lifecycle methods (constructors and destructors) see the section about [Value lifecycle](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/).

TODO

This decorator is due for reconsideration. Lack of custom copy/move/destroy logic and "passability in a register" are orthogonal concerns and should be split. This former logic should be subsumed into a more general [`@value("trivial")`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/decorators/value.html) decorator, which is orthogonal from `@register_passable`.
