# constrained

Implements compile time contraints.

These are Mojo built-ins, so you don't need to import them.

## `constrained`

`constrained[cond: Bool, msg: StringLiteral]()`

Compile time checks that the condition is true.

The `constrained` is similar to `static_assert` in C++ and is used to introduce constraints on the enclosing function. In Mojo, the assert places a constraint on the function. The message is displayed when the assertion fails.

**Parameters:**

- ​**cond** (`Bool`): The bool value to assert.
- ​**msg** (`StringLiteral`): The message to display on failure.
